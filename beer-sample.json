After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.\r\n\r\nGenerally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.","ibu":0,"name":"Winter Ale","type":"beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the “never settle” philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last year’s monument to hops.\r\n\r\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, “This is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.” In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\r\n\r\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\r\n\r\nLimited Availability April through June.\r\n\r\nDon’t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\r\n\r\nAvailable April through June.\r\n\r\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\r\n\r\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIBU 95\r\n\r\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto: chris mather\r\nRatings, Awards \u0026 Notables\r\n\r\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\r\n2007 World Beer Awards\r\n\r\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\r\n2006 International Beer Challenge\r\n\r\nGold Medal, 92 Points\r\n2006 World Beer Championships\r\n\r\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\r\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\r\n\r\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\r\n5 out 5 stars \r\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to “Imperial IPA” status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\r\n“This one is lovely,” said taster Tom Conti. “They got it just right.”\r\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. “They sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[there’s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,” one taster observed.\r\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\r\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. “This is a beautiful beer,” concluded taster Gregg Glaser. “Full of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.”\r\n“Not for the timid,” said taster Robert Lachman.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","type":"beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":8.75,"brewery_id":"deschutes_brewery"}

Hedonistic!\"Mellow Beer Emboldened by Hops,\" Elaine Louies article in the New York TimesDining Out Section, (March 24, 1999) announced the release of latest Rogue elixir to be bottled. The article states that \"The newest beer of Rogue Ales sounds more aggressive than it is. Brutal Bitter is actually full-bodied, deeply flavored, intensely hoppy brew. There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips. The aftertaste is clean.\"\r\n\r\nRogue brewer John Maier describes his Brutal Bitter as a cross between a Very Extra Special Bitter and an Indian Pale Ale. Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Customer demand prompted Rogue to continue brewing Brutal for the Horse Brass as well as using it as Rogues premier pour at the 1998 Oregon Brewers Festival. At the 1999 SpringFest in Portland, Oregon, Brutal Bitter was unscientifically voted the Peoples Choice--it received twice as many votes as the runner-up.\r\n\r\nBrutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping. The English malts used are floor malted Pipkin (a mellow cross of Maris Otter and Warboys, from an English company called Beeston), Cara Vienna and Cara Wheat. Brutal Bitter is packaged in Rogues classic 22 ounce silk-screened bottle, 12-ounce 6-pack (new for 2005), and is available on draft.","srm":0,"style":"Extra Special Bitter"}

The brewery started very small and was at first situated behind a house. In 1995 the brewery moved to her present facility. With moving there, the brewingcapacity greatly enhanced due to new brewing-, fermenting- and lagerfacilities. Christoffel brews according to the German Reinheitsgebot von 1516: which means the brewingprocess takes place in a completely natural way. Around the year 1990, Christoffel Blond was awarded 3 years in a row with the Dutch title: Best Beer from the Netherlands.","phone":"31-71.51.56.085"}

Dedicated to the homebrewer in each of us--the homebrewer who inspired this creation is Chris Studach, a friend of Rogues resident wizard John Maier, who added a Northwest twist to the classic style by adding hazelnuts for the host homebrew at the 1993 American Homebrewers Association convention. Chris put the nut in nut brown!\r\n\r\nHazelnut Brown Nectar Ale is a blend of Great Western 2-row Pale, Munich, Hugh Baird Brown, Crystal 80 and Crystal 135, Carastan, and Beeston Pale Chocolate malts; hazelnut extract; Perle and Saaz hops. HazelNut Brown Nectar is available in a 22-ounce bottle, a special commemorative 3-litre bottle with ceramic swing-top, and on draft."}

{"city":"Portland","name":"Allagash Brewing","phone":"1-800-330-5385","state":"Maine","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","website":"http://www.allagash.com/","address":["100 Industrial Way"],"country":"United States","description":"Allagash Brewing Company sold its first batch of beer in the summer of 1995. The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990's when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the méthode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery's fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England's original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry's most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":43.7028,"lon":-70.3166},"type":"brewery","code":"4103"}

With every stop he made in Erie came an equal number of stops at our brewery. One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports. In tribute to this folklore our expert brewers introduce Derailed Black Cherry Ale – brewed with fresh sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.","type":"brewery"}

{"description":"This dark lager combines the characteristics of three winter beer styles. All three of these styles traditionally come from the colder harsher areas of Europe. The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.","ibu":0,"name":"Black Rye Bock","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","type":"beer","upc":0,"abv":6.2,"brewery_id":"glacier_brewhouse","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","category":"German Lager","srm":0}

There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.\r\n\r\nAt the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have – and we didn’t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\r\n\r\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\r\n\r\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We don’t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore.","ibu":0,"style":"Oatmeal Stout","upc":0,"abv":4.8,"name":"Blast Furnace Oatmeal Stout","srm":0,"type":"beer"}

Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is to provide a ‘tropical lifestyle’ drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content.","ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"abv":5,"brewery_id":"tropical_beverage_international_co_ltd","name":"Phuket Lager","style":"American-Style Lager","type":"beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

{"description":"Monteith’s Summer Ale is a refreshingly different beer. The opportunity to rediscover some flavour highlights of beer styles enjoyed on summer days past, and bring them back to life.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last century, in England, Europe and the Americas and in New Zealand, there was still an adherence to brew with barley, wholesome grains, hops and other traditional brewing spices.\r\n\r\nMonteith’s Summer Ale is a bright gold beer with great body from four different malts. Spiced with a single hop variety and a touch of history - a little Rata honey. Subtle, but enough to make all the difference. The result is a truly refreshing herbal spiced beer brewed for the Summer Season — a splendid thirst quencher.\r\n\r\nMonteith’s Summer Ale enjoyed ice-cold with a simple range of fruits, perhaps refreshing wedge of orange or lime.

Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a “beer \u0026 wine license” and subsequently transformed the European-style café into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. \r\n\r\nThe cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right— temperature, glass, presentation. \r\n\r\n“No hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.” \r\n\r\nGruit is an old style—one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Café Amsterdam’s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting.

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","type":"beer","upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

Its rich history includes partnerships with local taverns, preservation of local historical pieces, unique tours, family style dining options and most importantly, great beer. President Russ Klisch said it all started with his brother, Jim.  Jim expressed interest in beer making near his birthday and Russ humored him by purchasing him a book on the subject.  Jim read the book and brewed the beer.  Although not known, according to Russ, as a gourmet cook, Jim made a good beer.  Russ was impressed and decided he could do it better.  In short, sibling competitiveness and common interest lead both to entering contests in beer making.  They both received awards, and family and friends encouraged them to start the business. Their family had roots in the beer industry as well.  Their grandfather worked for Schlitz driving a street sweeper and a truck.  Russ Klisch remembers him bringing home short fills to his dad.  He recalls, even as a kid, that it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.  Taverns were also owned by several family members. With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business.  They decided to start small.  Initially, they bought an old pizza bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest.  They liked the location and the fact that they could walk there from home.  They sold their first barrel on December 2, 1987.  They stayed at that location until winter of 1998.","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":43.0547,"lon":-87.9053},"website":"http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com/index.html"}

They moved the tradition to December in connection with the birth of Jesus. \r\nIn those days a farmer that did not set aside the best crop to produce the beer could lose his house to the king and the church. The law has been changed, but we promise you that we still use the very best of malt, yeast, hops, and pure Norwegian water to produce our Christmas beer.\r\n\r\nAass Juleøl has won most of the Norwegian Juleøl taste test conducted over time.

Light, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with microbrewed quality and freshness.\r\n\r\nBlanche is a thirst quenching beer that combines character and flavor with a moderate alcohol content.  Just try a bottle.  In the nose you'll notice spiciness from the coriander seeds and dried curacao orange peels added during the boil.

{"description":"Mama’s Little Yella Pils - Our upcoming new canned good is a small-batch version of the beer that made Pilsen, Czechoslovakia famous. Mama’s is made with hearty amounts of pale malt, German specialty malts, and a blend of traditional (Saaz) and 21st century Bavarian hops. Our first canned lager, it’s also fermented at cool temperatures with a German yeast.\r\n\r\nThis tasteful reality Czech is the perfect antidote for the watered-down versions of pilsner clogging America’s shelves. And Mama’s gentle hopping (about 35 IBUs) and low ABV (just 5.3%) mean we’re finally honoring consumer requests for a delicious but less-challenging beer. (Hey, we like a good low-dose session beer, too.) Look for our Gold Metal Winner on US shelves in March.\r\n\r\nSadly, the Feds rejected our “Take Two and Call Us in the Morning” line on the can.","name":"Mama's Little Yella Pils","style":"German-Style Pilsener","type":"beer","upc":0,"brewery_id":"oskar_blues_grill_and_brew","category":"German Lager","ibu":0,"srm":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":5.3}

Appropriately, the aroma is over-the-top, with pronounced piney and resiny hop flavors combined with tropical fruit esters and more subtle notes of toasted malts and alcohol. Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character.

We use seven types of malt and two varieties of hops to bring forth this big brew. Quite robust and roasty on the palate, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. \r\n\r\nOld Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.\r\n\r\nLike most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews, oysters, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts.\r\n\r\nOld Heathen is now available year-round.","ibu":0,"srm":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","category":"North American Ale","name":"Old Heathen","style":"American-Style Imperial Stout","type":"beer","upc":0}

A fuller malt foundation than some other pale ales, with some background spiciness. Dry, hoppy finish.\" In the SouthWest Brewing News, Feb/March 1994 issue, George Fix wrote \"A strong case could be made for Rogue Ale being included among the top 5 ales brewed in the US.\"\r\n\r\nYSB is amber in color with a mild hoppy finish. Brewed with a blend of 2-row Harrington and Crystal malts, Willamette and East Kent Golding hops.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site This Old House meets the World Wide Web�letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.  He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state. Head brewer Casey Hughes now produces four full-time styles, as well as a variety of seasonal beers.   The key word to describe all Flying Fish beers is balance. The beers are full-flavored, yet highly drinkable. Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Hopping is generous, but to style. Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Flying Fish beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, one can walk into any fine restaurant in the Philadelphia region and be pretty sure of finding a Flying Fish beer available. Flying Fish beers were the first in the region to be featured at the Great British Beer Festival, Oregon Brewers Festival and Canada's Biere de Mondial Festival. They have also won several medals at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago, the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 2000 book Best American Beers.","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":39.9121,"lon":-74.9701},"state":"New Jersey","type":"brewery"}

In England most of the beer is some kind of \"bitter\".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name \"bitter.\"  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\r\n\r\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale."}

From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end. Oh yeah, it's about 6% alcohol and around 100 IBUs."}

Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.\r\nThis yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\r\n\r\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested “wet” hops.","ibu":0,"name":"Glacier Harvest '09 Wet Hop (100 Barrel Series #28)","srm":0,"upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","brewery_id":"harpoon_brewery_boston"}

Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to “the original” pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hop’s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Company’s line up.","upc":0,"brewery_id":"santa_fe_brewing_company","category":"German Lager"}

{"description":"Every beer tells a story, and some are longer than others.\r\n\r\nConsider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.\r\n\r\nFor Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\r\n\r\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\r\n\r\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff.

Maibocks were originally brewed for the coming of spring, hence the name Mai (German for May).  The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, it is very different in character.  Don’t let it get you though, it’s a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.

{"srm":0,"upc":0,"description":"Our Anniversary Ale this year stems from 2 pilot beers that were brewed by members of Team Stone. The first was Jeremy Moynier’s incredibly delicious Oatmeal Stout, and the second was Jake Ratzke’s amazing homebrewed Imperial Stout that had authentic Oaxacan chocolate added to the boil. We loved both beers so much that we decided to combine the recipes to make this year’s Anniversary offering: Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. This beer pours deep black with a rich brown head of foam. The aroma is dominated by roast malt and cocoa. Upon tasting, the cocoa (we used unsweetened, unprocessed cacao sourced through our friends at Chuao Chocolatier) really comes through with a deep chocolate flavor and a long lasting bitter finish. The roasted grains used add coffee and licorice accents. It is a thick beer, but not sweet, with the addition of oatmeal in the mash providing a rich, silky mouthfeel that adds to the creamy texture.","ibu":0,"name":"Stone 12 Anniversery Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout","type":"beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":9.2,"brewery_id":"stone_brewing_co"}

Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. \r\n\r\nJust prior to the Great Alaska Beer \u0026 Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. \r\nThe plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast.

Most rauch brews are bottom fermented, however Rogue Smoke, is top fermented. It is orange-amber in hue with a delicate smoke aroma and flavor with an intense hop finish.\r\n\r\nIn All About Beer, August, 1995 issue, Christopher Brooks writes \"Alder wood, indigenous to the Northwest, is the smoking agent, though a small amount of Bamberg malt is used in the mash, too. Beech is drier than alder, reports brewmaster John Maier, so we use a little of that for added complexity. Welkommen, a smoky, nutty ale, is also very dry, which given the 15 pounds of hops (perle and Saaz) added to each 15-barrel batch, is no surprise.\" The seven medals in nine years which Rogue Smoke won at theGreat American Beer Festival in Denver are also a tribute to this unusual brew.\r\n\r\nRogue Smoke is brewed with Great Western Harrington, Klages, Munich, Hugh Baird Crystal, Carastan (30-37 and 13-17), Chucks Alderwood Smoked Munich and Bamberg Beechwood Smoked malts; plus Perle and Saaz hops. Rogue Smoke is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (replacing the older 7 ounce bottle) and on draft."}

The rye adds a tantalizing note of flavor on the palate with a hint of tartness you've come to expect from Rye.  Slightly warm when its young, the beer will age very well, perhap 5 years or more.  We're guessing that peak taste will be in the 1 to 2 year old range, with 3 and 4 not far behind.  Be sure to lay some down in your collection.","srm":0}

After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing.

The cola-colored beer (almost black) features a tan head, a creamy, skim-milk mouthfeel, and rich, semi-sweet flavors of caramel and chocolate throughout. The addition of smoked grains gives Old Chub a delicate kiss of smoke on the finish.  Old Chub is the beer equivalent of a lightly smoked single malt scotch, or your favorite dark chocolate.

It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\r\n\r\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\r\n\r\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye.

After establishing property for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations of the Wernesgrüner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany. [1] Throughout the company's history it has endured numerous changes of ownership. In 1762 the Günnel family bought the Schorer brewery. In 1774 the Männel family took over the bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002.

While traveling in Europe after college, we drank many wonderfully diverse, fresh, local beers.  We also saw firsthand how important local breweries were to their communities.  After our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell, deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.  We hope that our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":43.513,"lon":-72.4015},"name":"Harpoon Brewery - Windsor","phone":"1-802-674-5491","city":"Windsor","country":"United States","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

First up, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.\r\n\r\nDubbed Cocaoabunga, this unfiltered beer has a pleasant cocoa aroma, a subtle sweetness in the mouthfeel, a full-bodied flavor, and hints of vanilla.

{"category":"German Ale","description":"I’m sure everyone here knows, Pittsburgh has some humid summers.  What can you do to escape the heat and enjoy yourself?  Well I’ve got the answer.  How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because I’m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.","style":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":4.5,"brewery_id":"the_church_brew_works","srm":0,"type":"beer","ibu":0,"name":"Heavenly Hefeweizen"}

This bold stout boasts a rich, caramel sweetness lavished by a robust, deep-roasted heartiness you can sink your teeth into. ...Big Bear's bold flavors are produced using a blend of Belgian and English roasted barley and crystal malts. Some unique flavors come forth in the malt character. ...Louisiana sweet molasses and dark brown sugar. This dark brew is well hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops, which are somewhat, masked by the malt.

And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\n\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\n\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\n\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today.

It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\r\n\r\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass."}

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list. Head Brewer Tod Mott arrived in late 2003, bringing with him is award-winning ways and oursized personality. All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company. --http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/htmlpages.portsmouth/beerlist.html"}

The recipe calls for hops to be used in every step of the brewing process; in the mash, in a hop back, in the fermenter, and in the bright tanks. We use hop extract, hop pellets and hop flowers, hence the name Hop Juice. Hop Juice spends more than 4 weeks dry hopping in the fermenter and the bright beer tank.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","state":"Minnesota","website":"http://flatearthbrewing.com/"}

{"abv":6.5,"category":"North American Ale","description":"ach and every fall, we experience a coastal experience in San Diego known as the \"Super High Tide.\" This happens later in the Fall Season when the tidal swings reach a range of about 8 feet in difference between low and high tides. When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA? Brewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can't normally get. Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them.","name":"High Tide IPA","type":"beer","brewery_id":"port_brewing_company","ibu":0,"srm":0,"style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chris’ experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.\r\n\r\nThe Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose.

When the service men and women returned home to states outside of Coors' original 11-state marketing region, they spread the word about the beer's taste and quality -- which became known as the \"Coors Mystique.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to its national expansion in the 1980s, Coors' limited distribution left consumers in the eastern U.S. wanting a taste of the Rocky Mountains' finest beer. President Gerald Ford was known to take several cases of Coors on his Air Force One during return trips to the White House.\r\n\r\nIn September 1893, Coors competed for the first time at the Chicago World's Fair and won awards for brilliancy, flavor, chemical analysis and commercial flavor.  The award-winning legacy of the brew continues and in recent years Coors beer has won a number of honors at beer festivals.","style":"American-Style Light Lager","type":"beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":5,"brewery_id":"coors_brewing_golden_brewery","category":"North American Lager","ibu":0,"name":"Coors Original","srm":0,"upc":0}

All beers are made in accordance with the German beer purity law called the Reinheitsgebot which means that only the four classic ingredients are used in our beer: malted barley (and/or wheat), hops, water and yeast.

The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!","phone":"215-427-BREW (2739)","type":"brewery"}

It is brewed using a decoction mash, a time consuming, traditional four vessel brewing process discarded by many contemporary brewers. This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston Lager® also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.","ibu":0,"srm":0,"style":"American-Style Lager","upc":0}

During the summer of 1999 the business that is now Catawba Valley Brewing Company was born.\n\nIn April of 2007 the brewery relocated from Glen Alpine, NC to downtown Morganton, NC.  In the process we didn't lose a customer or miss a delivery.  In fact we achieved record spring sales.  In addition to relocating we've also opened our taproom to the public.

{"description":"Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is typically brewed in January then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released on the Friday after Thanksgiving. \r\n\r\nIn its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table. \r\n\r\nEach annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment. \r\n\r\nMidnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":13.2,"brewery_id":"midnight_sun_brewing_co","ibu":0,"name":"Arctic Devil Barley Wine","srm":0,"type":"beer","upc":0}

We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\r\n\r\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded – Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer.","srm":0,"upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":5.6,"brewery_id":"great_divide_brewing","ibu":0,"name":"Wild Raspberry Ale","style":"Fruit Beer","type":"beer"}

A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark.

Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer. I know I'm proud to say I had a hand in this one!!","name":"Wet Hop Requiem IPA","srm":0,"abv":5.2}

Glowing a deep amber color, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe, Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, Saaz, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas, not found in any other beer.\r\n\r\nOriginally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open), Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again.\r\n\r\nWe brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV, 1.068 OG) all year 'round. So if your local beer store doesn't have it, tell 'em to get moving!"}

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \"big sacks\" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind.

{"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":0,"brewery_id":"four_peaks_brewing","description":"Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \"Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!\r\n\r\nBelgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. \r\n\r\nYou will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove. Our version of a Belgian Wit is called \"Hoof - Hearted Wit,\" and it is brewed to style with dried bitter and sweet orange peel and coriander seeds.","ibu":0,"srm":0,"upc":0,"category":"Belgian and French Ale","name":"Belgian Wit","style":"Belgian-Style White","type":"beer"}

{"phone":"(207) 763-3305","website":"","code":"4849","name":"Andrew's Brewing","country":"United States","description":"Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":44.3516,"lon":-69.1401},"state":"Maine","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","address":[],"city":"Lincolnville"}

{"code":"17701","description":"Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is Williamsport's first production brewery since the 1950's. The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":41.238,"lon":-77.0103},"state":"Pennsylvania","website":"http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com","address":["429 W. 3rd St"],"city":"Williamsport","country":"United States","name":"Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company","phone":"570.332.5050","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).\r\n\r\nMorimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness. Morimoto Soba Ale is available in a 22 ounce silkscreened bottle and 13.2 gallon sankey kegs.\r\nTo learn more about the Chef, visit Morimotos web page.","ibu":0,"name":"Morimoto Soba Ale","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":0,"category":"Other Style","srm":0,"style":"Fruit Beer","type":"beer","upc":0}

{"phone":"716-763-5479","state":"New York","country":"United States","description":"Southern Tier Brewing Company was founded in 2004 by Phineas DeMink and Allen Yahn with the vision of bringing small batch brewing back to a region rich in brewing tradition. In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","code":"14750","geo":{"accuracy":"GEOMETRIC_CENTER","lat":42.1008,"lon":-79.3357},"name":"Southern Tier Brewing Co","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","website":"http://www.southerntierbrewing.com/","address":["2051A Stoneman Circle"],"city":"Lakewood"}

New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.","style":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale"}

The small town of Nagold, south of Stuttgart and west of the university town of Tübingen, is where the Anker Brewery can be found.   BWBW was founded by Stephen Demczuk of Baltimore, who was partner in Europe's first beer-of-the-month club, Beer Around the World. He, along with Baltimorean, Jim Seay and German beer importer Mr. Wolfgang Stark, styled a beer that would be appealing to the masses, drinkable and enjoyed by both the lager and ale drinker. From the assistance of master brewer Mr. Hans-Martin Walz of Anker Brewery, came The Raven, a beer brewed in honor of Baltimore's literary genius, Edgar Allan Poe. After more than a year operating in Europe, the world's most competitive beer market, production of The Raven began in Baltimore in June of 1998.","geo":{"lon":-76.54,"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lat":39.42},"state":"Maryland","type":"brewery","address":["P.O.

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebrüder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Bräu. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Bräu AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Schörghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V.

Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples – independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness.

{"city":"Cincinnati","code":"45214","description":"Established as a brewpub in 1995 in the historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company has since transitioned into a regionally distributed microbrewery offering an impressive selection of both innovative styles of ales and traditional lagers. Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","phone":"513-421-2337","state":"Ohio","type":"brewery","website":"http://www.barrelhouse.com","address":["544B W.

Hopheads. \r\n\r\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: “Why don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?”\r\n\r\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased.","ibu":0,"srm":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"smuttynose_brewing_co"}

We claim the unofficial record for production on a 10 barrel brewing system, with a whopping 42 batches in a single week. The addition of a new, 100-barrel brewhouse in 1995, and a Sankey-type keg system installed the following year, finally made it possible for us to serve the entire Pacific Northwest and later the Desert Southwest.  Brewing beer in Alaska isn't easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and the weather always has the last word.  We have learned to coordinate shipments for barges that couldn't dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters. Ah, but it all seems worthwhile if you can go home to a dinner of king crab or fresh halibut.","name":"Alaskan Brewing","phone":"1-907-780-5866","state":"Alaska","code":"99801","geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":58.3573,"lon":-134.49},"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","website":"http://www.alaskanbeer.com/"}

Made with five varieties of hops and a generous amount of specialty malts, it offers a complex flavor and aroma that is both aggressive and well balanced – a rare find among beers.\r\n\r\nThe Terrapin Rye Pale Ale was released in Athens, GA in April of 2002 at the Classic City Brew Fest. Six months later this beer which was sold only in Athens was awarded the American Pale Ale Gold Medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival, the most prestigious competition in North America. We hope you will agree with our peers in the brewing industry that this is truly one of the best pale ales in the country."}

The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","name":"Aass Brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

{"abv":8.7,"description":"Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. \r\n\r\nIt features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado’s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\r\n\r\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.\r\n\r\n--http://www.oskarblues.com/brew/","ibu":0,"upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","brewery_id":"oskar_blues_grill_and_brew","category":"North American Ale","name":"Gordon","srm":0,"style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","type":"beer"}

{"category":"North American Ale","description":"Many Mexican beer styles today are descendants of old Austrian styles, from when Austria ruled Mexico in the late 19th century. Our Dos Perros is made with German Munich malt, English Pale malt, and Chocolate malt, and hopped with Perle and Saaz hops. To lighten the body, as many Mexican brewers do, we add a small portion of flaked maize. The result is a wonderfully bready malt aroma, balanced with some maize sweetness and a noble hop finish.\r\n\r\nFood Pairings: The toasty malt flavors go great with barbeque, grilled salmon, carmelized onions, and most hot and spicy foods.

The brewers had a theory that if they loaded the beer with extra hops, the hops would preserve the beer. Of course, this added significantly to the beer’s flavor and aroma. When the troops returned to Britain, they had become \"hop-heads\", appreciating the beauty of the hop \"over-influence\". Regular pale ale was simply not enough anymore!

{"code":"1473","description":"History Wachusett Brewery founders Ned, Kevin and Peter developed a significant appreciation for beer while attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Adventures in biking, canoeing, and hiking that led the trio to the northern New England states allowed them to visit some of the first operating craft breweries. Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility. The three have never strayed from their plan to brew and sell the freshest, highest quality beers possible.","state":"Massachusetts","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","website":"http://www.wachusettbrew.com","phone":"978-874-9965","type":"brewery","address":["175 State Road East"],"city":"Westminster","country":"United States","geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":42.5586,"lon":-71.8715},"name":"Wachusetts Brewing Company"}

Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\r\n\r\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.\r\n\r\nThe overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.

We installed a 7 barrel brewery and served our first handcrafted beer brewed on the premises in October of 1992. In July of 1997, we celebrated our 10th anniversary by opening another location in Carlsbad. We expanded our brewing capacity into the building next door creating the opportunity to brew, bottle, distribute, and drink even more. Our distribution center is called PORT BREWING!  We found the perfect location in San Clemente and opened in July of 2003 enabling us to brew several additional styles! Let's party! When people started asking where they could get our beer besides Pizza Port enough, we acquired the old Stone Brewing facility in San Marcos at 155 Mata Way #104 to expand our distribution as PORT BREWING! We officially opened on Cinco de Mayo 2006. Now we will be able to make up to 10,000 barrels to get out to your other favorite places to enjoy coldies!

It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted. The bottle label reflects the McAleese family heritage, puctures the Kells Irish Pub logo, and a traditional Irish flutist. \r\n\r\nThe first Kells Irish Pub opened in Seattle in October 1983 in Post Alley, above the historic Pike Place Market. The restaurant will remind you of the Old Country with its warm, cozy atmosphere and traditional surroundings. Theres also a patio outside thats a great place to feel the breeze from the Puget Sound and the buzz from the Market. Kells has Seattles largest selection of Single Malt Scotch. \r\n\r\nThe Kells Irish Pub in Portland is a local landmark and has been named the #1 Irish Entertainment venue in America. Sit by the fire, belly up to the bar, check out the cigar room, and dont miss the St. Patricks Day Festival, the largest Irish Fest in Oregon. \r\n\r\nThe Pub in San Francisco is next to the historic North Beach neighborhood and reflects the Old World charm and hospitality the McAleese family brought with them from Ireland. \r\n\r\nKells Irish Lager has won world-wide acclaim by winning 8 medals from the World Beer Championship and a Gold Medal at the Australian International Beer Awards. \r\n\r\nKells Irish Lager is brewed with 7 ingredients: Great Western Pale, Crystal, Wheat and Acidulated Malts; Sterling Hops; Free Range COastal Water and Czech Pilsner Yeast."}

The hops used are Noble Tettnang Tettnanger hops. At the end of the kettle boil, we add a proprietary spice blend to give Samuel Adams® White Ale a unique and complex flavor, without being overpowering or cloying. The spice blend includes orange and lemon peel, dried plum, grains of paradise, coriander, anise, hibiscus, rose hips, tamarind, and vanilla. It is this special blend of spices that gives Samuel Adams® White Ale its unique character, complexity and refreshing drinkability.

{"type":"beer","upc":0,"brewery_id":"weyerbacher_brewing_company","description":"Merry Monks' Ale is a Belgian style Abby Trippel without limitation.  This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\r\n\r\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.\r\n\r\nYou might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink.","name":"Merry Monks","srm":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","abv":9.3,"category":"Belgian and French Ale","ibu":0,"style":"Belgian-Style Tripel"}

During the burning, the brewery in town, \"Ludwigs Brewery\" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier, or dark smoked lager. This beer uses all its ingredients from Bamberg, Germany, which is where the style was born and in by coincidence, the same area where Ludwig himself was born and taught to brew. It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma, taste, and dryness to the palate. The pilsner malt and noble German hops are used to balance this dryness making it very enjoyable as well as different. We believe this beer resembles how Ludwig himself might have brewed it over 100 years ago.","srm":0}

This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager.

Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.\r\n\r\nAnchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting \"ale\" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.\r\n\r\nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.\r\n\r\nSummer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and this—combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheat—makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.\r\n\r\n-http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beers/summerbeer.htm","name":"Anchor Summer Beer","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hops… Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aroma… we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; it’s the mark of the Tiger.","ibu":0,"name":"Bengali Tiger","type":"beer","brewery_id":"sixpoint_craft_ales","srm":0,"style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","upc":0,"updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20"}

Brewed with select hops, its distinct robust flavor is derived from a delicate combination of sweet maltiness and lingering herbal bitterness. Lord Chesterfield Ale's bright gold color is complemented by a lightly laced foam head and fragrant zesty aroma. This fine Ale compares with the very best crafty-style beers.

Rangers, fans and craft lovers everywhere were searching for hoppier beers. \r\n\r\nSo, here it finally is – New Belgium’s foray into the true American India Pale Ales. Bring out the hops! This clear amber beauty bursts at the starting gate with an abundance of hops: Cascade (citrus), Chinook (floral/citrus), and Simcoe (fruity) lead off the beer, with Cascade added again for an intense dry hop flavor. Brewed with pale and dark caramel malts that harmonize the hop flavor from start to finish, Ranger is a sessionable splendor for all you hopinistas.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment.
